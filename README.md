# R-Programming

A collection of R code and data sets.

# Logistic and Multiple Linear Regression

# Survival analysis.

1. Non-parametric models - Kaplan Meier (KM) Curves
   
2. Semi-parametric models - Cox-Proportional Hazards (CPH) Models

    * Stratified CPH Model

    * Stratified CPH Model + Frailty (random) Component Model

    * Stratified CPH Counting process (CP) Model

3. Full-parametric models - Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) Models
